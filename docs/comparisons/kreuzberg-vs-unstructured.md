## Migration Path

**From Unstructured to Kreuzberg**:
1. Deploy Kreuzberg API (Docker or native)
2. Update endpoint URLs in your code
3. Add `output_format=element_based` for Unstructured-compatible output
4. Test with sample documents
5. Optimize with Kreuzberg-specific features (hierarchy, per-page, embeddings)

**From Kreuzberg to Unstructured**:
1. Sign up for Unstructured API key
2. Update endpoint URLs
3. Remove `output_format` parameter (element-based is default)
4. Adjust for different metadata structure

## Roadmap & Future Features

### Kreuzberg Planned Features:
- ⏳ Enhanced chunking strategies (by_title, semantic)
- ⏳ Layout detection models (optional GPU acceleration)
- ⏳ More element types (Header, Footer, Formula)
- ⏳ Cloud-hosted option (for non-self-hosters)

### Unstructured Strengths:
- ✅ Mature ML models (layout, tables)
- ✅ Large community & integrations
- ✅ Managed service with SLA

## Verdict

**Kreuzberg** excels at:
- Performance (Rust native)
- Polyglot support (10 language bindings)
- Format coverage (56+ formats)
- Self-hosted deployments
- Cost efficiency (zero API fees)

**Unstructured** excels at:
- ML-powered layout analysis
- Managed cloud service
- Advanced chunking strategies
- Larger ecosystem

**Recommendation**:
- **High-volume, polyglot, self-hosted** → Kreuzberg
- **Rapid prototyping, managed service** → Unstructured
- **Hybrid approach**: Use both (Kreuzberg for bulk processing, Unstructured for complex layouts)
