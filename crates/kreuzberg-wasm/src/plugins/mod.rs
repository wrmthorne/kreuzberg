//! Plugin management for WASM bindings
//!
//! This module provides functions to register, unregister, and manage custom plugins
//! for document extraction, post-processing, validation, and OCR.
//!
//! All plugin functions operate on plugin objects passed from JavaScript that implement
//! the appropriate plugin protocol.
//!
//! # Threading Model and Safety (Main-Thread-Only)
//!
//! **BREAKING CHANGE**: As of v4.1, this module enforces main-thread-only execution
//! by removing unsafe Send/Sync implementations for JsValue.
//!
//! ## Thread Safety Guarantee
//! - JsValue is NOT Send/Sync - this is enforced by the type system
//! - All plugin registrations and callbacks MUST occur on the main thread
//! - WASM execution is single-threaded by default (no Web Workers)
//! - If multi-threading is enabled via `initThreadPool()`, plugin callbacks
//!   will fail to compile/run in worker contexts
//!
//! ## Why This Matters
//! JsValue contains pointers to JavaScript objects that are only valid in a specific
//! JS context. Allowing JsValue to cross thread boundaries causes:
//! - Memory corruption
//! - Use-after-free vulnerabilities
//! - Undefined behavior crashes
//!
//! ## Safe Migration
//! - All plugin registration/callback code must be on the main JS thread
//! - If you need async operations from workers, use message-passing to main thread
//! - Consider serializing plugin state instead of sharing JsValue objects
//!
//! See: https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen/issues/... (threading docs)

/// Wrapper that makes non-Send futures Send in WASM single-threaded contexts.

/// In WASM, JsFuture contains pointers to JavaScript promises that are not

/// thread by default, we can safely assert that JsFuture can be Send within
/// that single-threaded context.
///
/// This wrapper bridges the gap between:
/// - JsFuture (not Send, valid only on JS thread)
/// - async_trait's Send requirement (needed for trait objects)
///
/// # Safety Guarantee
///
/// This wrapper is sound ONLY when:
/// 1. Code runs in single-threaded WASM environment (default)
/// 2. Web Workers with `initThreadPool()` are NOT enabled
/// 3. Plugin callbacks are never spawned in rayon tasks
///
/// If any of these conditions are violated, undefined behavior occurs.

/// ## Safety Guarantee
/// - This wrapper is SAFE ONLY when accessed from the main JS thread
/// - WASM execution is single-threaded by default (target_arch = "wasm32")

/// ## Design
/// Rather than completely removing Send/Sync (which would prevent use with the
/// Plugin trait's Send + Sync bounds), we implement Send/Sync with a documented
/// SAFETY comment explaining the constraints.

/// This approach:
/// 1. Allows compilation in single-threaded WASM contexts
/// 2. Documents the thread safety assumption
/// 3. Makes the cost of violating the assumption explicit (unsafe keyword)

/// 1. Use message-passing channels instead of JsValue
/// 2. Serialize plugin configuration instead of sharing JsValue
/// 3. Create JsValue only on the main thread, pass results via channels
