/// Get an extractor from the registry.
///
/// This function acquires the registry read lock and retrieves the appropriate
/// extractor for the given MIME type.
///
/// # Performance
///
/// RwLock read + HashMap lookup is ~100ns, fast enough without caching.
/// Removed thread-local cache to avoid Tokio work-stealing scheduler issues.

/// Get optimal pool sizing hint for a document.
///
/// This function calculates recommended pool sizes based on the document's
/// file size and MIME type. The hint can be used to create appropriately
/// sized thread pools for extraction, reducing memory waste from over-allocation.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `file_size` - The size of the file in bytes
/// * `mime_type` - The MIME type of the document
///
/// # Returns
///
/// A `PoolSizeHint` with recommended pool configurations
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// use kreuzberg::core::extractor::get_pool_sizing_hint;
///
/// let hint = get_pool_sizing_hint(5_000_000, "application/pdf");
/// println!("Recommended string buffers: {}", hint.string_buffer_count);
/// ```

/// Convert a MIME type string to a pooled String for efficient deduplication.
///
/// This function uses the string interning pool to reduce memory allocations
/// for repeatedly used MIME types (e.g., "application/pdf" appears thousands of times
/// in batch processing). The interned string is converted to an owned String to satisfy
/// the ExtractionResult::mime_type field type.
///
/// # Performance
///
/// For pre-interned MIME types (all common types), this is O(1) pointer dereference.
/// For unknown MIME types, this allocates once per unique type and caches the result.
