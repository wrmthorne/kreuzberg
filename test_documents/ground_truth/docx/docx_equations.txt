This is a word document and this is an inline equation: $A = \pi r^{2}\$. If instead, I want an equation by line, I can do this:

$$\begin{array}{r}
a^{2} + b^{2} = c^{2}\  \times \ 23
\end{array}$$

And that is an equation by itself. Cheers!

This is another equation:

$$\begin{array}{r}
f(x) = a_{0} + \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}\left( a_{n}\cos\frac{n\pi x}{L} + b_{n}\sin\frac{n\pi x}{L} \right)
\end{array}$$

This is a word document and this is an inline equation: $A = \pi r^{2}\$. If instead, I want an equation by line, I can do this:

$$(x + a)^{n} = \sum_{k = 0}^{n}{\binom{n}{k}x^{k}a^{n - k}}$$

And that is an equation by itself. Cheers!

This is another equation:

$$(1 + x)^{n} = 1 + \frac{nx}{1!} + \frac{n(n - 1)x^{2}}{2!} + \ldots$$

This is a word document and this is an inline equation: $A = \pi r^{2}\$. If instead, I want an equation by line, I can do this:

$$e^{x} = 1 + \frac{x}{1!} + \frac{x^{2}}{2!} + \frac{x^{3}}{3!} + \ldots,\ \  - \infty < x < \infty$$

And that is an equation by itself. Cheers!
