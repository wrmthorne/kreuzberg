## [Unreleased]

### Added

#### PaddleOCR Backend
- **PaddleOCR backend via ONNX Runtime**: New OCR backend (`kreuzberg-paddle-ocr`) using PaddlePaddle's PP-OCRv4 models converted to ONNX format, run via ONNX Runtime. Supports 6 languages (English, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, German, French) with automatic model downloading and caching. Provides superior CJK recognition compared to Tesseract.
- **PaddleOCR support in all bindings**: Available across Python, Rust, TypeScript/Node.js, Go, Java, PHP, Ruby, C#, and Elixir bindings via the `paddle-ocr` feature flag.
- **PaddleOCR CLI support**: The `kreuzberg-cli` binary supports `--ocr-backend paddle-ocr` for PaddleOCR extraction.

#### Unified OCR Element Output
- **Structured OCR element data**: Extraction results now include `OcrElement` data with bounding geometry (rectangles and quadrilaterals), per-element confidence scores, rotation information, and hierarchical levels (word, line, block, page). Available from both PaddleOCR and Tesseract backends.

#### Shared ONNX Runtime Discovery
- **`ort_discovery` module**: Finds ONNX Runtime shared libraries across platforms, shared between PaddleOCR and future ONNX-based backends.

#### Document Structure Output
- **`DocumentStructure` support across all bindings**: Added structured document output with `include_document_structure` configuration option across Python, TypeScript/Node.js, Go, Java, PHP, Ruby, C#, Elixir, and WASM bindings.

#### Native DOC/PPT Extraction
- **OLE/CFB-based extraction**: Added native DOC and PPT extraction via OLE/CFB binary parsing. Legacy Office formats no longer require any external tools.

#### musl Linux Support
- **Re-enabled musl targets**: Added `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` and `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl` targets for CLI binaries, Python wheels (musllinux), and Node.js native bindings. Resolves glibc 2.38+ requirement for prebuilt CLI binaries on older distros like Ubuntu 22.04 (#364).

### Fixed

#### MSG Extraction Hang on Large Attachments (#372)
- Fixed `.msg` (Outlook) extraction hanging indefinitely on files with large attachments. Replaced the `msg_parser` crate with direct OLE/CFB parsing using the `cfb` crate — attachment binary data is now read directly without hex-encoding overhead.
- Added lenient FAT padding for MSG files with truncated sector tables produced by some Outlook versions.

#### Rotated PDF Text Extraction
- Fixed text extraction returning empty content for PDFs with 90° or 270° page rotation. Kreuzberg now strips `/Rotate` entries from page dictionaries before loading, restoring correct text extraction for all rotation angles.

#### CSV and Excel Extraction Quality
- Fixed CSV extraction producing near-zero quality scores (0.024) by outputting proper delimited text instead of debug format.
- Fixed Excel extraction producing low quality scores (0.22) by outputting clean tab/newline-delimited cell text.

#### XML Extraction Quality
- Improved XML text extraction to better handle namespaced elements, CDATA sections, and mixed content, improving quality scores.

#### WASM Table Extraction
- Fixed WASM adapter not recognizing `page_number` field (snake_case) from Rust FFI, causing table data to be silently dropped in Deno and Cloudflare Workers tests.

#### PaddleOCR Recognition Model
- Fixed PaddleOCR recognition model (`en_PP-OCRv4_rec_infer.onnx`) failing to load with `ShapeInferenceError` on ONNX Runtime 1.23.x.
- Fixed incorrect detection model filename in Docker and CI action (`en_PP-OCRv4_det_infer.onnx` → `ch_PP-OCRv4_det_infer.onnx`).

#### Python Bindings
- Fixed `OcrConfig` constructor silently ignoring `paddle_ocr_config` and `element_config` keyword arguments.

### Changed

#### Build System
- Bumped ONNX Runtime from 1.23.2 to 1.24.1 across CI, Docker images, and documentation.
- Bumped vendored Tesseract from 5.5.1 to 5.5.2.
- Bumped vendored Leptonica from 1.86.0 to 1.87.0.

### Removed

#### LibreOffice Dependency
- **LibreOffice is no longer required**: Legacy .doc and .ppt files are now extracted natively via OLE/CFB parsing. LibreOffice has been removed from Docker images, CI pipelines, and system dependency requirements, reducing the full Docker image size by ~500-800MB. Users on Kreuzberg <4.3 still need LibreOffice for these formats.

#### `msg_parser` Dependency
- Replaced `msg_parser` crate with direct CFB parsing for MSG extraction. Eliminates hex-encoding overhead and reduces dependency count.

#### Guten OCR Backend
- Removed all references to the unused Guten OCR backend from Node.js and PHP bindings. Renamed `KREUZBERG_DEBUG_GUTEN` env var to `KREUZBERG_DEBUG_OCR`.

## [4.2.15] - 2026-02-08

### Added

#### Agent Skill for AI Coding Assistants

- **Agent Skill for document extraction**: Added `skills/kreuzberg/SKILL.md` following the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) open standard, with comprehensive instructions for Python, Node.js, Rust, and CLI usage. Includes 8 detailed reference files covering API signatures, configuration, supported formats, plugins, and all language bindings. Works with Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Cursor, VS Code, Amp, Goose, Roo Code, and any compatible tool.

#### MIME Type Mappings
- Added `.docbook` (`application/docbook+xml`) and `.jats` (`application/x-jats+xml`) file extension mappings.

### Fixed

#### ODT List and Section Extraction
- Fixed ODT extractor not handling `text:list` and `text:section` elements. Documents containing bulleted/numbered lists or sections returned empty content.

#### UTF-16 EML Parsing
- Fixed EML files encoded in UTF-16 (LE/BE, with or without BOM) returning empty content. Detects UTF-16 encoding via BOM markers and heuristic byte-pattern analysis, transcoding to UTF-8 before parsing.

#### Email Attachment Metadata Serialization
- Fixed email extraction inserting a comma-joined string `"attachments"` into the `additional` metadata HashMap, which via `#[serde(flatten)]` overwrote the structured `EmailMetadata.attachments` array. This caused deserialization failures in Go, C#, and other typed bindings when processing emails with attachments.

#### WASM Office Document Support (DOCX, PPTX, ODT)
- DOCX, PPTX, and ODT extractors were gated on `#[cfg(all(feature = "tokio-runtime", feature = "office"))]` but `wasm-target` does not enable `tokio-runtime`. Changed cfg gates to `#[cfg(feature = "office")]` with conditional `spawn_blocking` only when `tokio-runtime` is available. Office documents now extract correctly in WASM builds.

#### WASM PDF Support in Non-Browser Runtimes
- PDFium initialization was guarded by `isBrowser()`, preventing PDF extraction in Node.js, Bun, and Deno. Removed the browser-only restriction so PDFium auto-initializes in all WASM runtimes.

#### Elixir PageBoundary JSON Serialization
- Added missing `@derive Jason.Encoder` to `PageBoundary`, `PageInfo`, and `PageStructure` structs in the Elixir bindings. Without this, encoding page structure metadata to JSON would fail with a protocol error.

#### Pre-built CLI Binary Missing MCP Command
- Pre-built standalone CLI binaries were built without the `mcp` feature flag, causing the `kreuzberg mcp` command to be unavailable. The build script now enables all features (`--features all`) to match the Python, Node, and Homebrew builds. Fixes #369.

#### PDF Error Handling Regression
- Reverted incorrect change from v4.2.14 that silently returned empty results for corrupted/malformed PDFs instead of propagating errors. Corrupted PDFs now correctly return `PdfError::InvalidPdf` and password-protected PDFs return `PdfError::PasswordRequired` as expected.

### Changed

#### API Parity
- Added `security_limits` field to all 9 language bindings (TypeScript, Go, Python, Ruby, PHP, Java, C#, WASM, Elixir) for API parity with Rust core `ExtractionConfig`.

---

## [4.2.14] - 2026-02-07

### Fixed

#### Excel File-Path Extraction
- Fixed `.xla` (legacy add-in) and `.xlsb` (binary spreadsheet) graceful fallback only applied to byte-based extraction; file-path-based extraction still propagated parse errors.

#### PDF Test Flakiness
- Fixed flaky PDF tests caused by concurrent pdfium access during parallel test execution. Added `#[serial]` to all pdfium-using tests to prevent global state conflicts.

#### Benchmark Fixtures
- Replaced auto-generated fixture discovery (`generate.rs`) with curated, validated fixture set.
- Added comprehensive fixture validation test suite (8 tests: JSON parsing, document existence, file sizes, ground truth, duplicate detection, format coverage).
- Removed 5 duplicate fixture entries pointing to the same test documents.
- Swapped encrypted EPUB fixture (`epub2_no_cover.epub` with IDPF font encryption) for clean `features.epub`.
- Fixed 272 stale `file_size` declarations in fixture JSON files to match actual files on disk.
- Fixed `validate_ground_truth.py` only checking root-level fixtures; now uses `rglob` for recursive validation.

### Removed
- Removed `generate.rs` auto-generation system from benchmark harness (caused recurring breakage from malformed vendored files).

---

## [4.2.13] - 2026-02-07

### Added

#### WASM Office Format Support
- Added office document extraction to the WASM target: DOCX, PPTX, RTF, reStructuredText, Org-mode, FictionBook, Typst, BibTeX, and Markdown are now available in the browser/WASM build.
- Added WASM integration tests for all new office formats (`office_extraction.rs`).
- Added e2e fixture definitions for RTF, RST, Org, FB2, Typst, BibTeX, and Markdown formats.
- Regenerated e2e test suites across all language bindings to include new office format fixtures.

#### Citation Extraction
- Added structured citation extraction for RIS (`.ris`), PubMed/MEDLINE (`.nbib`), and EndNote XML (`.enw`) formats via `biblib` crate with rich metadata including authors, DOI, year, keywords, and abstract.
- Added `CitationExtractor` with priority 60 for `application/x-research-info-systems`, `application/x-pubmed`, and `application/x-endnote+xml` MIME types.

#### JPEG 2000 OCR Support
- Added full JPEG 2000 image decoding for OCR via `hayro-jpeg2000` (pure Rust, memory-safe decoder). JP2 container and J2K codestream images are now decoded to RGB pixels for Tesseract OCR processing.
- Added pure Rust JP2 metadata parsing (dimensions, format detection) without external dependencies.

#### JBIG2 Image Support
- Added JBIG2 bi-level image decoding for OCR via `hayro-jbig2` (pure Rust, memory-safe decoder). JBIG2 is commonly used in scanned PDF documents.
- Added `image/x-jbig2` MIME type with `.jbig2` and `.jb2` file extension mappings.

#### Gzip Archive Extraction
- Added `GzipExtractor` for extracting text content from gzip-compressed files (`.gz`) via `flate2`, with decompression size limits to prevent gzip bomb attacks.

#### Extractor Registration
- Registered `JatsExtractor` and `DocbookExtractor` in the default extractor registry (extractors existed but were never registered).

#### MIME Type & Extension Mappings
- Added missing MIME types to `SUPPORTED_MIME_TYPES`: `text/x-fictionbook`, `application/x-fictionbook`, `text/x-bibtex`, `text/docbook`, `application/x-pubmed`.
- Added MIME type aliases for broader compatibility: `text/djot`, `text/jats`, `application/x-epub+zip`, `application/vnd.epub+zip`, `text/rtf`, `text/prs.fallenstein.rst`, `text/x-tex`, `text/org`, `application/x-org`, `application/xhtml+xml`, `text/x-typst`, `image/jpg`.
- Added missing file extension mappings: `.fb2`, `.opml`, `.dbk`, `.j2k`, `.j2c`, `.ris`, `.nbib`, `.enw`, `.typ`, `.djot`.

#### Security
- Wired `SecurityLimits` into the archive extraction pipeline: ZIP, TAR, 7z, and GZIP extractors now enforce configurable limits for max archive size, file count, compression ratio, and content size.
- Added `security_limits` field to `ExtractionConfig` for user-configurable archive security thresholds.
- ZIP archives are now validated with `ZipBombValidator` before extraction.
- Replaced hardcoded 256 MB gzip decompression limit with configurable `max_archive_size` (default 500 MB).

### Fixed

#### WASM Build
- Fixed `zstd-sys` build failure for `wasm32-unknown-unknown` by disabling default features on the `zip` crate and using `deflate-flate2` (pure Rust) instead of `zstd` (C code incompatible with WASM).
- Fixed `tokio`/`mio` compilation failure on WASM by removing `tokio-runtime` from the `office` feature (only needed for LibreOffice subprocess conversion, not in-memory parsers).
- Gated LibreOffice conversion paths (`libreoffice.rs`, legacy DOC/PPT handlers) behind `not(target_arch = "wasm32")` to prevent WASM builds from pulling in tokio filesystem and process APIs.

#### MIME Type Detection
- Fixed `.typ` files not recognized as Typst format; added `.typ` as an alias for `application/x-typst`.
- Fixed `.djot` files not recognized; added `.djot` extension mapping to `text/x-djot`.
- Fixed `application/gzip` rejected by MIME validation; added to `SUPPORTED_MIME_TYPES`.
- Fixed case-sensitive MIME type validation rejecting valid types with different casing (e.g., `macroEnabled` vs `macroenabled`); added RFC 2045 case-insensitive fallback.
- Synced `SUPPORTED_MIME_TYPES` with extractor registry to prevent valid formats being rejected before reaching their extractor.

#### Image Extraction
- Fixed JPEG 2000 images (`.jp2`) not handled by ImageExtractor; added `image/jp2`, `image/jpx`, `image/jpm`, and `image/mj2` to supported types.

#### Extraction
- Fixed YAML files rejected with "Unsupported format: application/yaml"; now accepts all four YAML MIME type variants including the standard `application/yaml` (RFC 9512).

#### CLI
- Fixed `.yml` config files rejected by `--config` flag; now accepts both `.yml` and `.yaml`.

#### .tgz Archive Extraction
- Fixed `.tgz` files parsed as raw TAR instead of gzip-compressed TAR. The MIME mapping now correctly routes `.tgz` to the GzipExtractor, which detects inner TAR archives via ustar magic bytes and delegates to TAR extraction.

#### Excel Exotic Formats
- Fixed `.xlam` (Excel add-in), `.xla` (legacy add-in), and `.xlsb` (binary spreadsheet) files causing extraction errors when they lack standard workbook data. These formats now gracefully return an empty workbook instead of propagating parse errors.

#### PDF Error Handling
- Fixed password-protected and malformed PDFs causing extraction errors. The PDF extractor now gracefully returns an empty `ExtractionResult` instead of propagating `PdfError::PasswordRequired` and `PdfError::InvalidPdf`.

#### Benchmark Harness
- Fixed framework initialization check running before external adapters (Tika, pdfplumber, etc.) were registered, causing false "failed to initialize" errors.
- Fixed missing `composer install` step in PHP benchmark CI job.
- Fixed C# benchmark wrapper using wrong MIME type casing for macro-enabled Office formats and incorrect djot MIME type.
- Fixed WASM benchmark wrapper missing MIME mappings for several supported formats.
- Added error counts (`framework_errors`, `harness_errors`) and error detail breakdown to benchmark aggregation output.
- Added distinct `ErrorKind::Timeout` tracking in benchmark results, propagated through aggregation and per-extension stats.
- Removed 12 malformed/password-protected/broken fixture files from benchmark corpus.

## [4.2.12] - 2026-02-06

### Fixed

#### DOCX Extraction
- Fixed DOCX list items missing whitespace between text runs, causing words to merge together. (#359)

---

## [4.2.11] - 2026-02-06

### Fixed

#### Python Bindings
- Fixed CLI binary missing from all platform wheels in the publish workflow. (#349)

### Fixed

#### OCR Heuristic

- **Pass actual page count to OCR fallback evaluator**: `evaluate_native_text_for_ocr` was called with `None` for page count, defaulting to 1. This inflated per-page averages for multi-page documents, causing scanned PDFs to skip OCR.
- **Per-page OCR evaluation for mixed-content PDFs**: Added `evaluate_per_page_ocr` which evaluates each page independently using page boundaries. If any single page triggers OCR fallback, the entire document is OCR'd. Previously, good pages masked scanned pages in the aggregate evaluation.

---

## [4.2.10] - 2026-02-05

### Fixed

#### MIME Type Detection
- Fixed DOCX/XLSX/PPTX files incorrectly detected as `application/zip` when using bytes-based MIME detection. (#350)

- Added per-page OCR evaluation so that mixed-content PDFs with some scanned pages are properly OCR'd.

---

## [4.2.8] - 2026-02-02

### Fixed

#### Python Bindings
- Fixed `ChunkingConfig` serialization outputting wrong field names (`max_characters`/`overlap` instead of `max_chars`/`max_overlap`).

#### Java Bindings
- Fixed ARM64 SIGBUS crash in `kreuzberg_get_error_details` by returning a heap-allocated pointer instead of struct-by-value.

- Reduced allocations in RST parser, fictionbook extractor, and email extractor.
- Replaced `HashMap` with `Vec` for small metadata maps and `AHashMap` for hot-path maps.
- Switched `Metadata.additional` keys to `Cow<'static, str>` for interning.
- Replaced `Vec<u8>` with `bytes::Bytes` for `ExtractedImage.data`, enabling zero-copy cloning.

---
